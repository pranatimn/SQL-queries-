# SQL-sample

I downloaded a real dataset from kaggle to practice writing SQL queries . 


It contains 120 years of Olympics History dataset in MS Excel format .


After downloading I found two files. The first one was athlete_events and the other was noc_regions file.


Then I opened pgadmin which is an open source management tool for PostgreSQL and created a table named  “OLYMPICS_HISTORY”.


Then I created another table named “OLYMPICS_HISTORY_NOC_REGIONS”.


Then I imported the the data from athlete_events to OLYMPICS_HISTORY and 

data from noc_regions file to OLYMPICS_HISTORY_NOC_REGIONS.
